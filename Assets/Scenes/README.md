# Sample Scene Documentation

The `SampleScene.unity` demonstrates basic usage of the ThemeUITool.

## What's in the Sample Scene

The sample scene includes examples of themed UI components in action. You can use this scene as a reference for setting up your own themed UI.

## Using the Sample Scene

1. Open `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity` in Unity
2. Examine the UI elements in the Hierarchy window
3. Select any themed UI component to see:
   - The Theme Selector component attached
   - The theme asset being used
   - How theme properties are applied

## Creating Your Own Themed UI

Based on the sample scene, you can:

1. **Create new themes**: Right-click in Project → Create → Themed UI → Choose component type
2. **Apply themes**: Add a Theme Selector component to your UI elements
3. **Customize themes**: Modify theme properties in the Inspector
4. **Mix and match**: Use different theme combinations for different UI contexts

## Theme Organization Tips

From the sample scene, notice how themes are organized:
- Keep all theme assets in a dedicated folder (e.g., `Assets/Themes/`)
- Use descriptive names for themes (e.g., "PrimaryButtonTheme", "DarkDropdownTheme")
- Create default themes for each component type
- Group related themes together

## Next Steps

- Experiment with modifying theme properties and seeing the changes in real-time
- Create your own theme variations
- Build complete UI systems using the themed components
